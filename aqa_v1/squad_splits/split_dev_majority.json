Under Kubiak, the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning's shotgun passing skills, but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line, as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998, due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer, and the simple fact that Manning was getting old, as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season.

He set the NFL's all-time record for career passing yards in this game, but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler, who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season. Osweiler was injured, however, leading to Manning's return during the Week 17 regular season finale, where the Broncos were losing 13\u20137 against the 4\u201311 San Diego Chargers, resulting in Manning re-claiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27\u201320 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed.

In 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars, the city became the official capital of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw, a puppet state of the First French Empire established by Napoleon Bonaparte. In accordance with the decisions of the Congress of Vienna, the Russian Empire annexed Warsaw in 1815 and it became part of the \"Congress Kingdom\". Only in 1918 did it regain independence from the foreign rule and emerge as a new capital of the independent Republic of Poland. The German invasion in 1939, the massacre of the Jewish population and deportations to concentration camps led to the uprising in the Warsaw ghetto in 1943 and to the major and devastating Warsaw Uprising between August and October 1944. Warsaw gained the title of the \"Phoenix City\" because it has survived many wars, conflicts and invasions throughout its long history. Most notably, the city required painstaking rebuilding after the extensive damage it suffered in World War II, which destroyed 85% of its buildings. On 9 November 1940, the city was awarded Poland's highest military decoration for heroism, the Virtuti Militari, during the Siege of Warsaw (1939).", "qas": [{"id": "5733140a4776f419006606e0", "question": "When is the first reference in history to Warsaw?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 64, "text": "1313"}]}, {"id": "5733140a4776f419006606e1", "question": "What city served as Poland's capital in 1313?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 85, "text": "Krak\u00f3w"}]}, {"id": "5733140a4776f419006606e2", "question": "When did Warsaw become the capital of the Kingdom of Poland?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 390, "text": "1596"}]}, {"id": "5733140a4776f419006606e3", "question": "Who moved his court from Krak\u00f3w to Warsaw in 1596?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 325, "text": "King Sigismund III Vasa"}]}, {"id": "5733140a4776f419006606e4", "question": "Why did Warsaw gain the title of the \"Phoenix City\"?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1250, "text": "survived many wars, conflicts and invasions"}]}]}, {"context": "The city is the seat of a Roman Catholic archdiocese (left bank of the Vistula) and diocese (right bank), and possesses various universities, most notably the Polish Academy of Sciences and the University of Warsaw, two opera houses, theatres, museums, libraries and monuments.

However, average teacher salaries have improved rapidly in recent years. US teachers are generally paid on graduated scales, with income depending on experience. Teachers with more experience and higher education earn more than those with a standard bachelor's degree and certificate. Salaries vary greatly depending on state, relative cost of living, and grade taught. Salaries also vary within states where wealthy suburban school districts generally have higher salary schedules than other districts. The median salary for all primary and secondary teachers was $46,000 in 2004, with the average entry salary for a teacher with a bachelor's degree being an estimated $32,000. Median salaries for preschool teachers, however, were less than half the national median for secondary teachers, clock in at an estimated $21,000 in 2004. For high school teachers, median salaries in 2007 ranged from $35,000 in South Dakota to $71,000 in New York, with a national median of $52,000. Some contracts may include long-term disability insurance, life insurance, emergency/personal leave and investment options. The American Federation of Teachers' teacher salary survey for the 2006-07 school year found that the average teacher salary was $51,009. In a salary survey report for K-12 teachers, elementary school teachers had the lowest median salary earning $39,259. High school teachers had the highest median salary earning $41,855. Many teachers take advantage of the opportunity to increase their income by supervising after-school programs and other extracurricular activities. In addition to monetary compensation, public school teachers may also enjoy greater benefits (like health insurance) compared to other occupations. Merit pay systems are on the rise for teachers, paying teachers extra money based on excellent classroom evaluations, high test scores and for high success at their overall school. Also, with the advent of the internet, many teachers are now selling their lesson plans to other teachers through the web in order to earn supplemental income, most notably on TeachersPayTeachers.com.", "qas": [{"id": "56e77a8700c9c71400d7718a", "question": "In general, what were teachers paid in the past?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 37, "text": "relatively low salaries"}]}, {"id": "56e77a8700c9c71400d7718b", "question": "What has been getting much better in the most recent years?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 71, "text": "average teacher salaries"}]}, {"id": "56e77a8700c9c71400d7718c", "question": "What two factors can generally increase a teacher's salary?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 238, "text": "more experience and higher education"}]}, {"id": "56e77a8700c9c71400d7718d", "question": "In a report on K-12 teachers, which teachers had the lowest median salary?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1348, "text": "elementary school teachers"}]}, {"id": "56e77a8700c9c71400d7718e", "question": "What website are teachers using to sell their lesson plans?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2142, "text": "TeachersPayTeachers.com"}]}]}, {"context": "There are many forms of spiritual or religious teachers in Christianity, across all three major traditions - (Roman) Catholic, (Eastern) Orthodox Catholic, and Protestant/Non-Denominational, with a stronger tradition of spiritual formation in the more historic and authoritarian/hierarchical Christian traditions with a long tradition of \"discernment of spirits\", of vocations, and other aspects of spiritual life, especially the Roman and Orthodox Catholic Churches.

He wrote, \"All the articles of our Christian faith, which God has revealed to us in His Word, are in presence of reason sheerly impossible, absurd, and false.\" and \"[That] Reason in no way contributes to faith. [...] For reason is the greatest enemy that faith has; it never comes to the aid of spiritual things.\" However, though seemingly contradictorily, he also wrote in the latter work that human reason \"strives not against faith, when enlightened, but rather furthers and advances it\", bringing claims he was a fideist into dispute. Contemporary Lutheran scholarship, however, has found a different reality in Luther. Luther rather seeks to separate faith and reason in order to honor the separate spheres of knowledge that each applies to. Bernhard Lohse, for example, has demonstrated in his classic work \"Fides und Ratio\" that Luther ultimately sought to put the two together. More recently, Hans-Peter Grosshans has demonstrated that Luther's work on Biblical Criticism stresses the need for external coherence in the right exegetical method. This means that for Luther it is more important that the Bible is reasonable according to the reality outside of the scriptures than that the Bible makes sense to itself, that it has internal coherence.

The stator consists of a similar, but fixed, series of blades that serve to redirect the steam flow onto the next rotor stage.

In the vast majority of large electric generating stations, turbines are directly connected to generators with no reduction gearing. Typical speeds are 3600 revolutions per minute (RPM) in the USA with 60 Hertz power, 3000 RPM in Europe and other countries with 50 Hertz electric power systems. In nuclear power applications the turbines typically run at half these speeds, 1800 RPM and 1500 RPM. A turbine rotor is also only capable of providing power when rotating in one direction.

In the 18th century, Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis made experiments with scorpion venom and observed that certain dogs and mice were immune to this venom. This and other observations of acquired immunity were later exploited by Louis Pasteur in his development of vaccination and his proposed germ theory of disease.

Helper T cell activation also requires longer duration of engagement with an antigen-presenting cell. The activation of a resting helper T cell causes it to release cytokines that influence the activity of many cell types. Cytokine signals produced by helper T cells enhance the microbicidal function of macrophages and the activity of killer T cells.

Under the terms of the affiliation, the schools were required to have courses of study comparable to those at the university, to notify the university early of any contemplated faculty appointments or dismissals, to make no faculty appointment without the university's approval, and to send copies of examinations for suggestions. The University of Chicago agreed to confer a degree on any graduating senior from an affiliated school who made a grade of A for all four years, and on any other graduate who took twelve weeks additional study at the University of Chicago. A student or faculty member of an affiliated school was entitled to free tuition at the University of Chicago, and Chicago students were eligible to attend an affiliated school on the same terms and receive credit for their work. The University of Chicago also agreed to provide affiliated schools with books and scientific apparatus and supplies at cost; special instructors and lecturers without cost except travel expenses; and a copy of every book and journal published by the University of Chicago Press at no cost. The agreement provided that either party could terminate the affiliation on proper notice.

This standard model of particle physics posits a similarity between the forces and led scientists to predict the unification of the weak and electromagnetic forces in electroweak theory subsequently confirmed by observation. The complete formulation of the standard model predicts an as yet unobserved Higgs mechanism, but observations such as neutrino oscillations indicate that the standard model is incomplete. A Grand Unified Theory allowing for the combination of the electroweak interaction with the strong force is held out as a possibility with candidate theories such as supersymmetry proposed to accommodate some of the outstanding unsolved problems in physics. Physicists are still attempting to develop self-consistent unification models that would combine all four fundamental interactions into a theory of everything. Einstein tried and failed at this endeavor, but currently the most popular approach to answering this question is string theory.:212\u2013219", "qas": [{"id": "5737821cc3c5551400e51f19", "question": "Who formed the universal theory of gravitation?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 125, "text": "Isaac Newton"}]}, {"id": "5737821cc3c5551400e51f1a", "question": "In what century was quantum mechanics made?

The unbalanced force that accelerates an object can be resolved into a component that is perpendicular to the path, and one that is tangential to the path. This yields both the tangential force, which accelerates the object by either slowing it down or speeding it up, and the radial (centripetal) force, which changes its direction.", "qas": [{"id": "5737a5931c456719005744e7", "question": "Where does centripetal force go?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 291, "text": "toward the center of the curving path"}]}, {"id": "5737a5931c456719005744e8", "question": "How do centripetal forces act in relation to vectors of velocity?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 346, "text": "perpendicular"}]}, {"id": "5737a5931c456719005744e9", "question": "What force changes an objects direction of travel?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 837, "text": "centripetal"}]}, {"id": "5737a5931c456719005744ea", "question": "What is another word for centripetal force?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 829, "text": "radial"}]}, {"id": "5737a5931c456719005744eb", "question": "What is resposible for speeding up or slowing down an object?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 729, "text": "tangential force"}]}]}, {"context": "A conservative force that acts on a closed system has an associated mechanical work that allows energy to convert only between kinetic or potential forms.
