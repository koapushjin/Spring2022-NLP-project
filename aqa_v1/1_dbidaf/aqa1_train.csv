Yale proved important as a site for this research. The leaders of these groups were Ross Granville Harrison, Grace E. Pickford, and G. Evelyn Hutchinson, and their members included both graduate students and more experienced scientists. All produced innovative research, including the opening of new subfields in embryology, endocrinology, and ecology, respectively, over a long period of time. Harrison's group is shown to have been a classic research school; Pickford's and Hutchinson's were not. Pickford's group was successful in spite of her lack of departmental or institutional position or power. Hutchinson and his graduate and postgraduate students were extremely productive, but in diverse areas of ecology rather than one focused area of research or the use of one set of research tools. Hutchinson's example shows that new models for research groups are needed, especially for those that include extensive field research."",""qas"":[{""id"":""821607441c173838196c4d1500c2ab21a044e6b0"",""question"":""what year were the research groups compared"",""answers"":[{""answer_start"":7,""text"":""2003""}]},{""id"":""c2ec259c6453424d8c40ee804faec3e14c6fa80b"",""question"":""who did not have departmental power"",""answers"":[{""answer_start"":237,""text"":""Grace E.

Debates were covered on front pages of college newspapers and emphasized in yearbooks, and team members even received the equivalent of athletic letters for their jackets. There even were rallies sending off the debating teams to matches. Yet, the debates never attained the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed. One reason may be that debates do not have a clear winner, as is the case in sports, and that scoring is subjective. In addition, with late 19th-century concerns about the impact of modern life on the human body, athletics offered hope that neither the individual nor the society was coming apart."",""qas"":[{""id"":""0e139a8436c69dc5b33f35673917847e27a7c77d"",""question"":""In what way were athletics and debate not treated differently?"",""answers"":[{""answer_start"":401,""text"":""athletic letters for their jackets""}]},{""id"":""90265e71601e626a7e73f636cfaca3564352f7a3"",""question"":""How did athletics guide the formation of debate?"",""answers"":[{""answer_start"":168,""text"":""the rhetoric, symbolism, and metaphors used in athletics were used to frame these early debates""}]},{""id"":""9ff3b27bacd5289b3d4739c562afd1771a48abf6"",""question"":""What were the three schools involved in the debate at the beginning of the 20th century?"",""answers"":[{""answer_start"":138,""text"":""Harvard, Yale, and Princeton""}]},{""id"":""bb048d2af3346afda198ecc64f4c8ac753291438"",""question"":""What was something debate was lacking that athletics was capable of doing for people?"",""answers"":[{""answer_start"":808,""text"":""hope""}]},{""id"":""e38dbd715fdb7471f227933bd3c142f9b7e31ef2"",""question"":""How might we know today that debates were important to colleges in the early 20th Century?"",""answers"":[{""answer_start"":265,""text"":""Debates were covered on front pages of college newspapers and emphasized in yearbooks""}]},{""id"":""0de657f7c20ebb36c72f55aafb75370d0ac6e31d"",""question"":""what is the first time period mentioned?"",""answers"":[{""answer_start"":8,""text"":""1892""}]},{""id"":""dcb98f23717b35d5d7defd689d0da37e754aa348"",""question"":""what is the second time period mentioned?"",""answers"":[{""answer_start"":89,""text"":""1909""}]},{""id"":""62ec859a40cec1f7697a3e1b5f7a26008ced6262"",""question"":""what is the first place mentioned?"",""answers"":[{""answer_start"":19,""text"":""Harvard""}]},{""id"":""dc687f37a6b2435e46215363225b539fee6b2a82"",""question"":""what is the second place mentioned?"",""answers"":[{""answer_start"":31,""text"":""Yale""}]},{""id"":""ffeb9b16c627fd14e9798eb9585998547b63677d"",""question"":""what group is mentioned last?"",""answers"":[{""answer_start"":845,""text"":""the society""}]}]},{""context"":""Yale is organized into fourteen constituent schools: the original undergraduate college, the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and twelve professional schools.

Cynics such as Diogenes of Sinope rejected all material possessions and social conventions (nomos) as unnatural and useless. The Cyrenaics meanwhile, embraced hedonism, arguing that pleasure was the only true good. Stoicism, founded by Zeno of Citium, taught that virtue was sufficient for eudaimonia as it would allow one to live in accordance with Nature or Logos. Zeno became extremely popular, the Athenians set up a gold statue of him and Antigonus II Gonatas invited him to the Macedonian court. The philosophical schools of Aristotle (the Peripatetics of the Lyceum) and Plato (Platonism at the Academy) also remained influential. The academy would eventually turn to Academic Skepticism under Arcesilaus until it was rejected by Antiochus of Ascalon (c. 90 BCE) in favor of Neoplatonism. Hellenistic philosophy, had a significant influence on the Greek ruling elite. Examples include Athenian statesman Demetrius of Phaleron, who had studied in the lyceum; the Spartan king Cleomenes III who was a student of the Stoic Sphairos of Borysthenes and Antigonus II who was also a well known Stoic. This can also be said of the Roman upper classes, were Stoicism was dominant, as seen in the Meditations of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius and the works of Cicero."",""qas"":[{""id"":""08438e26025460232cfbcbe4e5aa8b23c21dbb72"",""question"":""Who invited the founder of a philosophy that taught that virtue was sufficient for eudaimonia to the Macedonian court?"",""answers"":[{""answer_start"":706,""text"":""Antigonus II Gonatas""}]},{""id"":""f44a9c164e24f0ad0ce88aadf778b8ae8a8929fa"",""question"":""What philosophy was founded by a man of whom the Athenians set up a gold statue?"",""answers"":[{""answer_start"":477,""text"":""Stoicism""}]},{""id"":""b946c7b516a8054eeb7117e4f16b8273ea5e8bfa"",""question"":""What defining institution of the Greek world was rejected by those who promoted atomism an an asceticism based on freedom from pain, as well as by those who rejected all material possessions and social conventions?"",""answers"":[{""answer_start"":106,""text"":""the polis""}]},{""id"":""befa60c45ac0863e3fdd5ea69d49505faee31362"",""question"":""What work by a Roman emperor shows the influence of Stoicism on the Roman upper classes?"",""answers"":[{""answer_start"":1456,""text"":""Meditations""}]},{""id"":""de4f7696d7d07c3586b19c4b2fc58a5490a97c63"",""question"":""What would allow one to live in accordance with Nature according to the philosophy of which Sphairos of Borysthenes and Antigonus II were both adherents?"",""answers"":[{""answer_start"":526,""text"":""virtue""}]}]},{""context"":""Scholars and historians are divided as to what event signals the end of the Hellenistic era.

Lysimachus, who had seized Macedon and Thessaly for himself, was forced into war when Seleucus invaded his territories in Asia minor and was defeated and killed in 281 BCE at the Battle of Corupedium, near Sardis.

The Cafe Procope on the Left Bank dates from this period. In the 20th century, the cafés of the Left Bank, especially Café de la Rotonde and Le Dôme Café in Montparnasse and Café de Flore and Les Deux Magots on Boulevard Saint Germain, all still in business, were important meeting places for painters, writers and philosophers. A bistro is a type of eating place loosely defined as a neighbourhood restaurant with a modest decor and prices and a regular clientele and a congenial atmosphere. Its name is said to have come in 1814 from the Russian soldiers who occupied the city; \""bistro\"" means \""quickly\"" in Russian, and they wanted their meals served rapidly so they could get back their encampment. Real bistros are increasingly rare in Paris, due to rising costs, competition from cheaper ethnic restaurants, and different eating habits of Parisian diners. A brasserie originally was a tavern located next to a brewery, which served beer and food at any hour. Beginning with the Paris Exposition of 1867; it became a popular kind of restaurant which featured beer and other beverages served by young women in the national costume associated with the beverage, particular German costumes for beer.

An example of five consecutive doubled letters is the word voorraaddoos (food storage container). The diaeresis (Dutch: trema) is used to mark vowels that are pronounced separately when involving a pre- or suffix. Whereas a hyphen is used when this problem occurs in compound words.

The population rose to some 400 million, but taxes and government revenues were fixed at a low rate, virtually guaranteeing eventual fiscal crisis. Corruption set in, rebels tested government legitimacy, and ruling elites did not change their mindsets in the face of changes in the world system. Following the Opium War, European powers imposed unequal treaties, free trade, extraterritoriality and treaty ports under foreign control. The Taiping Rebellion (1850–64) and Dungan Revolt (1862–77) in Central Asia led to the deaths of some 20 million people. In spite of these disasters, in the Tongzhi Restoration of the 1860s, Han Chinese elites rallied to the defense of the Confucian order and the Qing rulers. The initial gains in the Self-Strengthening Movement were destroyed in the First Sino-Japanese War of 1895, in which the Qing lost its influence over Korea and the possession of Taiwan. New Armies were organized, but the ambitious Hundred Days' Reform of 1898 was turned back by Empress Dowager Cixi, a ruthless but capable leader. When, in response to the violently anti-foreign Yihetuan (\""Boxers\""), foreign powers invaded China, the Empress Dowager declared war on them, leading to defeat and the flight of the Imperial Court to Xi'an."",""qas"":[{""id"":""df1088563acc2cf460fcf0c570bc122f096d4745"",""question"":""Which came first, Qianlong Emperor or Tongzhi Restoration?"",""answers"":[{""answer_start"":17,""text"":""Qianlong Emperor""}]},{""id"":""28f4355a78e72ae06267869a5bc9c5189767d0a7"",""question"":""Which happened first, the Dungan Revolt or the Hundred Days' Reform?"",""answers"":[{""answer_start"":588,""text"":""Dungan Revolt""}]},{""id"":""ebdc80b04cda612c34fe2cb1adef8f45e822afd2"",""question"":""Which happened first, the Taiping Rebellion or the Hundred Days' Reform?"",""answers"":[{""answer_start"":556,""text"":""Taiping Rebellion""}]},{""id"":""9a534bc8a62c4fc316483b42910d0f246c026f76"",""question"":""Which happened first, the First Sino-Japanese War or the Hundred Days' Reform?"",""answers"":[{""answer_start"":904,""text"":""First Sino-Japanese War""}]},{""id"":""ec090e43541c3a00b0c621680bf1191d65a6c2d2"",""question"":""Which happened first, the Opium War or the Taiping Rebellion?"",""answers"":[{""answer_start"":427,""text"":""Opium War""}]}]}]",Qing_dynasty
