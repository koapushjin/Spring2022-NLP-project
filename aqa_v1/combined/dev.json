In the compound engine, high-pressure steam from the boiler expands in a high-pressure (HP) cylinder and then enters one or more subsequent lower-pressure (LP) cylinders. The complete expansion of the steam now occurs across multiple cylinders and as less expansion now occurs in each cylinder less heat is lost by the steam in each. This reduces the magnitude of cylinder heating and cooling, increasing the efficiency of the engine. By staging the expansion in multiple cylinders, torque variability can be reduced. To derive equal work from lower-pressure steam requires a larger cylinder volume as this steam occupies a greater volume. Therefore, the bore, and often the stroke, are increased in low-pressure cylinders resulting in larger cylinders.", "qas": [{"id": "1a24fd81486aa448eab6b0774ef10a41e6806b2e", "question": "What happened in the fifth year of the 19th century?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A method to lessen the magnitude of this heating and cooling was invented"}]}, {"id": "5d581b9dd6d9c95693ce1863c6e0ea3e003021ca", "question": "What happened in the 6th year of the 19th century?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 120, "text": "patented his Woolf high-pressure compound engine"}]}, {"id": "7e532563af3f996bc5be15fe66700db123d9d381", "question": "Multiple cylinders allows what to happen to the engine?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 472, "text": "less heat is lost by the steam in each"}]}, {"id": "2d7f660211054fbee19be1cef8db1358a696a245", "question": "Why is the bore and stroke increased?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 696, "text": "To derive equal work"}]}, {"id": "152e4a238abdc4c471b1d4d95c69912bf1383b45", "question": "What does the \"L\" in \"LP\" represent?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 318, "text": "lower"}]}]}, {"context": "The efficiency of a Rankine cycle is usually limited by the working fluid.

He saw the Turks as a scourge sent to punish Christians by God, as agents of the Biblical apocalypse that would destroy the antichrist, whom Luther believed to be the papacy, and the Roman Church. He consistently rejected the idea of a Holy War, \"as though our people were an army of Christians against the Turks, who were enemies of Christ. This is absolutely contrary to Christ's doctrine and name\". On the other hand, in keeping with his doctrine of the two kingdoms, Luther did support non-religious war against the Turks. In 1526, he argued in Whether Soldiers can be in a State of Grace that national defence is reason for a just war. By 1529, in On War against the Turk, he was actively urging Emperor Charles V and the German people to fight a secular war against the Turks. He made clear, however, that the spiritual war against an alien faith was separate, to be waged through prayer and repentance. Around the time of the Siege of Vienna, Luther wrote a prayer for national deliverance from the Turks, asking God to \"give to our emperor perpetual victory over our enemies\".", "qas": [{"id": "f65c4991d17743f2641aba924e01505112403970", "question": "What action did luther not support?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 135, "text": "resisting the Turks"}]}, {"id": "5e58f30b932c2597b68a6bfa72b336189bc24896", "question": "How is Luther quoted as describing how others viewed the Turks?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 565, "text": "enemies of Christ"}]}, {"id": "8def17985691d932c083a516d4707a636bc0dedb", "question": "What work did Luther author that urged the creator to aid in the battle against the Turks?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1205, "text": "a prayer for national deliverance"}]}, {"id": "ceb5d923e19b202178d3529a96a418788d0a72f7", "question": "What prayer did Luther offer?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1218, "text": "national deliverance from the Turks, asking God to \"give to our emperor perpetual victory over our enemies\""}]}, {"id": "3efa7ff79dfd15e0e342a62749b6d314eb8b863a", "question": "What did Luther perceive to be the way to be victorious in a religious war?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1121, "text": "through prayer and repentance"}]}, {"id": "85e381cae1faca7f054ed96d8267acbaa31ee636", "question": "For Luther, what would justify war?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 840, "text": "national defence"}]}, {"id": "1560c880b88574cb98448c0fb4db85cff8bfb22e", "question": "In what year had Luther not yet published Whether Soldiers can be in a State of Grace?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 162, "text": "1518"}]}, {"id": "97e6acc0cf7b57c6e87e66886622b6343869cbff", "question": "Which Luther work regarding war came out a few years prior to the 1529 work?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 791, "text": "Whether Soldiers can be in a State of Grace"}]}, {"id": "14a8e48370489521d6f4a1851ae645860fe13ebf", "question": "Which Luther work began Luther's delve into the arena of war with the Turks?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 167, "text": "Explanation of the Ninety-five Theses"}]}]}, {"context": "Luther made his pronouncements from Wartburg in the context of rapid developments at Wittenberg, of which he was kept fully informed.

The conservation of momentum can be directly derived from the homogeneity or symmetry of space and so is usually considered more fundamental than the concept of a force. Thus the currently known fundamental forces are considered more accurately to be \"fundamental interactions\".:199\u2013128 When particle A emits (creates) or absorbs (annihilates) virtual particle B, a momentum conservation results in recoil of particle A making impression of repulsion or attraction between particles A A' exchanging by B. This description applies to all forces arising from fundamental interactions. While sophisticated mathematical descriptions are needed to predict, in full detail, the accurate result of such interactions, there is a conceptually simple way to describe such interactions through the use of Feynman diagrams. In a Feynman diagram, each matter particle is represented as a straight line (see world line) traveling through time, which normally increases up or to the right in the diagram. Matter and anti-matter particles are identical except for their direction of propagation through the Feynman diagram. World lines of particles intersect at interaction vertices, and the Feynman diagram represents any force arising from an interaction as occurring at the vertex with an associated instantaneous change in the direction of the particle world lines.
