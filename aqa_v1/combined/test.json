Evidence accumulating since the 1980s indicates that the \"cydippids\" are not monophyletic, in other words do not include all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor, because all the other traditional ctenophore groups are descendants of various cydippids.", "qas": [{"id": "73756a872f754e2d781eb0b38d6dd115ccf20fce", "question": "What was discovered in 1980s?", "answers": []}, {"id": "852b240623aea4f0f116b88eaffa26746596974f", "question": "Relative to modern ctenophore, do fossil ctenophores have more tentacles or comb-rows?", "answers": []}, {"id": "347866c44ef615250e67f8ec6271f7181d226290", "question": "What has been argued about ctenophores?", "answers": []}, {"id": "721cf18190817da268379dc661f5ca24f909928f", "question": "Which of the following is more closely related to ctenophores, cnidarians or cydippids?", "answers": []}, {"id": "4ca9c57e7e8125f16055147eda30feaf53d38269", "question": "Which era came later, Cambrian or Cretaceous?", "answers": []}, {"id": "2bab6e03b6be227abd00c7fe53f0559b0baa92c7", "question": "What was found in fossilized ctenophores?", "answers": []}, {"id": "0bd1b54984d098d5e816123a9e095491d5da19ed", "question": "Are Cniderians more closely related to bilaterians or ctenophores?", "answers": []}, {"id": "aa6e17f8b6e824e8a3f3573335d15297f04444ad", "question": "To what branch of the evoluntionary tree do ctenophores belong?", "answers": []}, {"id": "88b66b0cc1530456a8ee56065db3200c4c43a1b5", "question": "What is said about bilaterians and cnidarians along with ctenophores?", "answers": []}, {"id": "55f36a037590416d5d6503cdd246952ef25c63d4", "question": "Which of the following is not a group of animals: Iagerstatten, cnidarians or cypdippids?", "answers": []}, {"id": "50661a6ad68e372a635f8b0c1fba80d5e5487b53", "question": "Who are ctenophores related to?", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "The tentacles of cydippid ctenophores are typically fringed with tentilla (\"little tentacles\"), although a few genera have simple tentacles without these sidebranches. The tentacles and tentilla are densely covered with microscopic colloblasts that capture prey by sticking to it. Colloblasts are specialized mushroom-shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis, and have three main components: a domed head with vesicles (chambers) that contain adhesive; a stalk that anchors the cell in the lower layer of the epidermis or in the mesoglea; and a spiral thread that coils round the stalk and is attached to the head and to the root of the stalk. The function of the spiral thread is uncertain, but it may absorb stress when prey tries to escape, and thus prevent the collobast from being torn apart. In addition to colloblasts, members of the genus Haeckelia, which feed mainly on jellyfish, incorporate their victims' stinging nematocytes into their own tentacles \u2013 some cnidaria-eating nudibranchs similarly incorporate nematocytes into their bodies for defense. The tentilla of Euplokamis differ significantly from those of other cydippids: they contain striated muscle, a cell type otherwise unknown in the phylum Ctenophora; and they are coiled when relaxed, while the tentilla of all other known ctenophores elongate when relaxed. Euplokamis' tentilla have three types of movement that are used in capturing prey: they may flick out very quickly (in 40 to 60 milliseconds); they can wriggle, which may lure prey by behaving like small planktonic worms; and they coil round prey. The unique flicking is an uncoiling movement powered by contraction of the striated muscle. The wriggling motion is produced by smooth muscles, but of a highly specialized type. Coiling around prey is accomplished largely by the return of the tentilla to their inactive state, but the coils may be tightened by smooth muscle.", "qas": [{"id": "b4ea4168acc5279a5e6bb3b94c4914d4d68f3b2a", "question": "Which are bigger, tentilla or colloblasts?", "answers": []}, {"id": "6a414c2d3fb655db97796fd63465d8f027803cb6", "question": "In which portion of skin do you find colloblasts?", "answers": []}, {"id": "ba12216986011f07cd4affe9f982d91271faf90b", "question": "What fungus do colloblasts resemble?", "answers": []}, {"id": "691b714cb5ea3730c38740123df5bbcea755155b", "question": "Which of the following does not eat jellyfish: Haeckelia or Euplokamis?", "answers": []}, {"id": "38b61d6c5e19381548c34d413794a45683bd801b", "question": "What is unique about the muscles of the little tentacles of Euplokamis?", "answers": []}, {"id": "65a4908ea56dbd6a0e62ecae85578478a9b48ae5", "question": "What size tentacles are tentilla?", "answers": []}, {"id": "2ac5b09aea864c770219a77ae485ac2c68185d3d", "question": "Which of the following is not part of the colloblasts: a domed head, a stalk or nematocytes?", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "The Lobata have a pair of lobes, which are muscular, cuplike extensions of the body that project beyond the mouth.

Beroids prey mainly on other ctenophores. Some jellyfish and turtles eat large quantities of ctenophores, and jellyfish may temporarily wipe out ctenophore populations. Since ctenophores and jellyfish often have large seasonal variations in population, most fish that prey on them are generalists, and may have a greater effect on populations than the specialist jelly-eaters.

A series of studies that looked at the presence and absence of members of gene families and signalling pathways (e.g., homeoboxes, nuclear receptors, the Wnt signaling pathway, and sodium channels) showed evidence congruent with the latter two scenarios, that ctenophores are either sister to Cnidaria, Placozoa and Bilateria or sister to all other animal phyla. Several more recent studies comparing complete sequenced genomes of ctenophores with other sequenced animal genomes have also supported ctenophores as the sister lineage to all other animals. This position would suggest that neural and muscle cell types were either lost in major animal lineages (e.g., Porifera) or that they evolved independently in the ctenophore lineage. However, other researchers have argued that the placement of Ctenophora as sister to all other animals is a statistical anomaly caused by the high rate of evolution in ctenophore genomes, and that Porifera (sponges) is the earliest-diverging animal phylum instead.

From the EU's foundation, the Court of Justice also held that the Treaties allowed citizens or corporations to bring claims against EU and member state institutions for violation of the Treaties and Regulations, if they were properly interpreted as creating rights and obligations.

All actions by EU institutions can be subject to judicial review, and judged by standards of proportionality, particularly where general principles of law, or fundamental rights are engaged.

This has meant both the European Court of Justice and the highest national courts have had to develop principles to resolve conflicts of laws between different systems. Within the EU itself, the Court of Justice's view is that if EU law conflicts with a provision of national law, then EU law has primacy. In the first major case in 1964, Costa v ENEL, a Milanese lawyer, and former shareholder of an energy company, named Mr Costa refused to pay his electricity bill to Enel, as a protest against the nationalisation of the Italian energy corporations. He claimed the Italian nationalisation law conflicted with the Treaty of Rome, and requested a reference be made to both the Italian Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice under TFEU article 267. The Italian Constitutional Court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962, and the treaty was in force from 1958, Costa had no claim. By contrast, the Court of Justice held that ultimately the Treaty of Rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation, and in any case under the Treaty provisions only the Commission could have brought a claim, not Mr Costa. However, in principle, Mr Costa was entitled to plead that the Treaty conflicted with national law, and the court would have a duty to consider his claim to make a reference if there would be no appeal against its decision. The Court of Justice, repeating its view in Van Gend en Loos, said member states \"albeit within limited spheres, have restricted their sovereign rights and created a body of law applicable both to their nationals and to themselves\" on the \"basis of reciprocity\". EU law would not \"be overridden by domestic legal provisions, however framed... without the legal basis of the community itself being called into question.\" This meant any \"subsequent unilateral act\" of the member state inapplicable. Similarly, in Amministrazione delle Finanze v Simmenthal SpA, a company, Simmenthal SpA, claimed that a public health inspection fee under an Italian law of 1970 for importing beef from France to Italy was contrary to two Regulations from 1964 and 1968. In \"accordance with the principle of the precedence of Community law,\" said the Court of Justice, the \"directly applicable measures of the institutions\" (such as the Regulations in the case) \"render automatically inapplicable any conflicting provision of current national law\". This was necessary to prevent a \"corresponding denial\" of Treaty \"obligations undertaken unconditionally and irrevocably by member states\", that could \"imperil the very foundations of the\" EU.

Where the different institutions cannot agree at any stage, a \"Conciliation Committee\" is convened, representing MEPs, ministers and the Commission to try and get agreement on a joint text: if this works, it will be sent back to the Parliament and Council to approve by absolute and qualified majority. This means, legislation can be blocked by a majority in Parliament, a minority in the Council, and a majority in the Commission: it is harder to change EU law than stay the same. A different procedure exists for budgets. For \"enhanced cooperation\" among a sub-set of at least member states, authorisation must be given by the Council. Member state governments should be informed by the Commission at the outset before any proposals start the legislative procedure.

Reflecting the economic nature of the project, the European Community originally focused upon free movement of workers: as a \"factor of production\". However, from the 1970s, this focus shifted towards developing a more \"social\" Europe. Free movement was increasingly based on \"citizenship\", so that people had rights to empower them to become economically and socially active, rather than economic activity being a precondition for rights. This means the basic \"worker\" rights in TFEU article 45 function as a specific expression of the general rights of citizens in TFEU articles 18 to 21. According to the Court of Justice, a \"worker\" is anybody who is economically active, which includes everyone in an employment relationship, \"under the direction of another person\" for \"remuneration\". A job, however, need not be paid in money for someone to be protected as a worker. For example, in Steymann v Staatssecretaris van Justitie, a German man claimed the right to residence in the Netherlands, while he volunteered plumbing and household duties in the Bhagwan community, which provided for everyone's material needs irrespective of their contributions. The Court of Justice held that Mr Steymann was entitled to stay, so long as there was at least an \"indirect quid pro quo\" for the work he did. Having \"worker\" status means protection against all forms of discrimination by governments, and employers, in access to employment, tax, and social security rights. By contrast a citizen, who is \"any person having the nationality of a Member State\" (TFEU article 20(1)), has rights to seek work, vote in local and European elections, but more restricted rights to claim social security. In practice, free movement has become politically contentious as nationalist political parties have manipulated fears about immigrants taking away people's jobs and benefits (paradoxically at the same time). Nevertheless, practically \"all available research finds little impact\" of \"labour mobility on wages and employment of local workers\".", "qas": [{"id": "c632fe9a17ef9b2ede23249c7ea5111b00203da2", "question": "What did Mr Steynmann fight for?", "answers": []}, {"id": "f6c95813743a77225fa8af84c05053e9d58ba72a", "question": "Who have made the free movement of workers controversial?", "answers": []}, {"id": "cae63ff7e598cdfbfd28a64d999e04d0f7a918c6", "question": "Who is someone in an employment relationship considered?", "answers": []}, {"id": "d0e79b49e10fddf0ef11fd5a494bc93acb9fba11", "question": "What are citizens allowed to do?", "answers": []}, {"id": "920406615d9bd9161c1dc12c17b421956fb36b4e", "question": "What is the most typical form of payment for a job?", "answers": []}, {"id": "324adfa41395c64caddef01d4e0955fa22d341b0", "question": "Which article has broader scope, 21 or 45?", "answers": []}, {"id": "fb1423a906e3e3ddcf5ccff7e6250ffb5031c404", "question": "Which of the following rights is not granted by worker status: tax, vote or social security?", "answers": []}, {"id": "edeacb2f7e1534ef41ac94b603368f2d14630c9d", "question": "What are workers protected from?", "answers": []}, {"id": "dec3c6278f4f752c21736654dad6eef8fd89f932", "question": "Steymann could stay in the Netherlands even though he was not a?", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "In regard to companies, the Court of Justice held in R (Daily Mail and General Trust plc) v HM Treasury that member states could restrict a company moving its seat of business, without infringing TFEU article 49. This meant the Daily Mail newspaper's parent company could not evade tax by shifting its residence to the Netherlands without first settling its tax bills in the UK. The UK did not need to justify its action, as rules on company seats were not yet harmonised. By contrast, in Centros Ltd v Erhversus-og Selkabssyrelsen the Court of Justice found that a UK limited company operating in Denmark could not be required to comply with Denmark's minimum share capital rules. UK law only required \u00a31 of capital to start a company, while Denmark's legislature took the view companies should only be started up if they had 200,000 Danish krone (around \u20ac27,000) to protect creditors if the company failed and went insolvent. The Court of Justice held that Denmark's minimum capital law infringed Centros Ltd's freedom of establishment and could not be justified, because a company in the UK could admittedly provide services in Denmark without being established there, and there were less restrictive means of achieving the aim of creditor protection. This approach was criticised as potentially opening the EU to unjustified regulatory competition, and a race to the bottom in standards, like in the US where the state Delaware attracts most companies and is often argued to have the worst standards of accountability of boards, and low corporate taxes as a result. Similarly in \u00dcberseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH the Court of Justice held that a German court could not deny a Dutch building company the right to enforce a contract in Germany on the basis that it was not validly incorporated in Germany. Although restrictions on freedom of establishment could be justified by creditor protection, labour rights to participate in work, or the public interest in collecting taxes, denial of capacity went too far: it was an \"outright negation\" of the right of establishment. However, in Cartesio Oktat\u00f3 \u00e9s Szolg\u00e1ltat\u00f3 bt the Court of Justice affirmed again that because corporations are created by law, they are in principle subject to any rules for formation that a state of incorporation wishes to impose. This meant that the Hungarian authorities could prevent a company from shifting its central administration to Italy while it still operated and was incorporated in Hungary. Thus, the court draws a distinction between the right of establishment for foreign companies (where restrictions must be justified), and the right of the state to determine conditions for companies incorporated in its territory, although it is not entirely clear why.", "qas": [{"id": "e191447108eec42b6586ea8c0f9f46d0e514df62", "question": "Who was the defendant in Centros Ltd vs Erhversus-og Selkabssyrelsen?", "answers": []}, {"id": "5be35bc2013dca56053ab23c47170ec1252c0839", "question": "who didn't have to explain its reasons", "answers": []}, {"id": "386377d09b95b311afa72359116e404209848cdc", "question": "who can stop companies from going elsewhere", "answers": []}, {"id": "f36c576b938c137294c76734c88a0aa261095766", "question": "Who was the plaintiff in Centros Ltd v Erhversus-og Selkabssyrelsen?", "answers": []}, {"id": "f65970c9bbff237f87a275d565bd109e6beceaf5", "question": "Which of the following is a currency: krone, the Daily Mail or TFEU?", "answers": []}, {"id": "585e429ced6ffe4c968a186b9af415c60c63be48", "question": "Which of the following is not a valid reason to restrict freedom of establishment: labour rights, the public interest in collecting taxes, or creditor protection?", "answers": []}, {"id": "36cf8d298f040fd32161f28125c28fca186813ad", "question": "Who was the plaintiff in Uberseering BV v.

For such \"indirect\" discriminatory (or \"indistinctly applicable\") measures the Court of Justice has developed more justifications: either those in article 36, or additional \"mandatory\" or \"overriding\" requirements such as consumer protection, improving labour standards, protecting the environment, press diversity, fairness in commerce, and more: the categories are not closed. In the most famous case Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol f\u00fcr Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government's arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought. This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product's content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians would believe it was butter if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate: it would \"considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view\" and labelling would protect consumers \"just as effectively\". In a 2003 case, Commission v Italy Italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as \"chocolate\". It had to be \"chocolate substitute\". All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed the law infringed article 34. The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a \"chocolate substitute\" label. This was derogatory in the consumers' eyes. A \u2018neutral and objective statement\u2019 was enough to protect consumers. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe article 34. So, in a 2009 case, Commission v Italy, the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34.

In Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen it was held that the provisions of the Treaties (and EU Regulations) are directly effective, if they are (1) clear and unambiguous (2) unconditional, and (3) did not require EU or national authorities to take further action to implement them. Van Gend en Loos, a postal company, claimed that what is now TFEU article 30 prevented the Dutch Customs Authorities charging tariffs, when it imported urea-formaldehyde plastics from Germany to the Netherlands. After a Dutch court made a reference, the Court of Justice held that even though the Treaties did not \"expressly\" confer a right on citizens or companies to bring claims, they could do so. Historically, international treaties had only allowed states to have legal claims for their enforcement, but the Court of Justice proclaimed \"the Community constitutes a new legal order of international law\". Because article 30 clearly, unconditionally and immediately stated that no quantitative restrictions could be placed on trade, without a good justification, Van Gend en Loos could recover the money it paid for the tariff. EU Regulations are the same as Treaty provisions in this sense, because as TFEU article 288 states, they are \u2018directly applicable in all Member States\u2019. Moreover, member states comes under a duty not to replicate Regulations in their own law, in order to prevent confusion. For instance, in Commission v Italy the Court of Justice held that Italy had breached a duty under the Treaties, both by failing to operate a scheme to pay farmers a premium to slaughter cows (to reduce dairy overproduction), and by reproducing the rules in a decree with various additions. \"Regulations,\" held the Court of Justice, \"come into force solely by virtue of their publication\" and implementation could have the effect of \"jeopardizing their simultaneous and uniform application in the whole of the Union.\" On the other hand, some Regulations may themselves expressly require implementing measures, in which case those specific rules should be followed.", "qas": [{"id": "8ccabd1cd217c946590509632efb2180a0482647", "question": "What activity was carried out by Van Gend en Loos in Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen?", "answers": []}, {"id": "f64e727b8922d31fe2aca57ce930e69f7c3530c7", "question": "What is the EU made up of?", "answers": []}, {"id": "54056d93fbab599adf1a387d38fae901d251637a", "question": "What was the act of Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen in Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen being disputed?", "answers": []}, {"id": "8ca2b1cb3e6687417724b695c0d8a762b84b4d50", "question": "What group won in Commission v Italy?", "answers": []}, {"id": "ed1c353559ec34d810418da16723a1e1134cc2ec", "question": "What do EU Regulations not have if they are conditional?", "answers": []}, {"id": "c26b503e6aa3928887d4009f2710d0c4dcc6d4ef", "question": "What would happen if farmers decided to own less cattle?", "answers": []}, {"id": "81f71b49dd10b5ae786ca46ecb6c962ae96ab971", "question": "What did Van Gend en Loos do?", "answers": []}, {"id": "f3dd865f3cb5437caa614ab599263099a484d4b1", "question": "The Court of Justice ruled against the Dutch in which case?", "answers": []}, {"id": "37bba4a2e4ce8f1ef2b035e781c6d3bb7f3758bf", "question": "What party in Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Balstingen lost?", "answers": []}, {"id": "e15e38031cd5774c52b8f68fb8b76edabdbdbbe2", "question": "Who won in Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen?", "answers": []}, {"id": "a59733386e2017b513225571d8985fe38154d006", "question": "Who lost in Commission v Italy?", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "The judicial branch of the EU has played an important role in the development of EU law, by assuming the task of interpreting the treaties, and accelerating economic and political integration.

There is also a Civil Service Tribunal to deal with EU staff issues, and then a separate Court of Auditors.

A president is elected by the judges for three years. Under TEU article 19(3) is to be the ultimate court to interpret questions of EU law.

According to the standard theory of comparative advantage, two countries can both benefit from trade even if one of them has a less productive economy in all respects. Like in other regional organisations such as the North American Free Trade Association, or the World Trade Organisation, breaking down barriers to trade, and enhancing free movement of goods, services, labour and capital, is meant to reduce consumer prices. It was originally theorised that a free trade area had a tendency to give way to a customs union, which led to a common market, then monetary union, then union of monetary and fiscal policy, political and eventually a full union characteristic of a federal state. In Europe, however, those stages were considerably mixed, and it remains unclear whether the \"endgame\" should be the same as a state, traditionally understood. In practice free trade, without standards to ensure fair trade, can benefit some people and groups within countries (particularly big business) much more than others, but will burden people who lack bargaining power in an expanding market, particularly workers, consumers, small business, developing industries, and communities. The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union articles 28 to 37 establish the principle of free movement of goods in the EU, while articles 45 to 66 require free movement of persons, services and capital. These so-called \"four freedoms\" were thought to be inhibited by physical barriers (e.g. customs), technical barriers (e.g. differing laws on safety, consumer or environmental standards) and fiscal barriers (e.g. different Value Added Tax rates). The tension in the law is that the free movement and trade is not supposed to spill over into a licence for unrestricted commercial profit. The Treaties limit free trade, to prioritise other values such as public health, consumer protection, labour rights, fair competition, and environmental improvement. Increasingly the Court of Justice has taken the view that the specific goals of free trade are underpinned by the general aims of the treaty for improvement of people's well being.", "qas": [{"id": "18a77152fa8176464228ffb8c47a4d504deed81a", "question": "What is the final article of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to establish the principle of free movement of goods?", "answers": []}, {"id": "83f0c3885dbe04fe8ab6dee04d63cdefe180a536", "question": "Which of the following concepts was codified first, the social market economy or free movement?", "answers": []}, {"id": "645af9b8a686ac620bce1bd181ca43f3733ed6f9", "question": "Which comes later, a common market or the union of monetary and fiscal policy?", "answers": []}, {"id": "80582fbeb5aa794a3601388ef28fba8d8ff1b30c", "question": "What is the first article of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to establish the principle of free movement of goods?", "answers": []}, {"id": "fb773b84fdead9f12efb65ec682b2f6311dde51a", "question": "What comes first, customs union or monetary union?", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "The Free Movement of Workers Regulation articles 1 to 7 set out the main provisions on equal treatment of workers. First, articles 1 to 4 generally require that workers can take up employment, conclude contracts, and not suffer discrimination compared to nationals of the member state. In a famous case, the Belgian Football Association v Bosman, a Belgian footballer named Jean-Marc Bosman claimed that he should be able to transfer from R.F.C. de Li\u00e8ge to USL Dunkerque when his contract finished, regardless of whether Dunkerque could afford to pay Li\u00e8ge the habitual transfer fees. The Court of Justice held \"the transfer rules constitute[d] an obstacle to free movement\" and were unlawful unless they could be justified in the public interest, but this was unlikely. In Groener v Minister for Education the Court of Justice accepted that a requirement to speak Gaelic to teach in a Dublin design college could be justified as part of the public policy of promoting the Irish language, but only if the measure was not disproportionate. By contrast in Angonese v Cassa di Risparmio di Bolzano SpA a bank in Bolzano, Italy, was not allowed to require Mr Angonese to have a bilingual certificate that could only be obtained in Bolzano. The Court of Justice, giving \"horizontal\" direct effect to TFEU article 45, reasoned that people from other countries would have little chance of acquiring the certificate, and because it was \"impossible to submit proof of the required linguistic knowledge by any other means\", the measure was disproportionate. Second, article 7(2) requires equal treatment in respect of tax. In Finanzamt K\u00f6ln Altstadt v Schumacker the Court of Justice held that it contravened TFEU art 45 to deny tax benefits (e.g. for married couples, and social insurance expense deductions) to a man who worked in Germany, but was resident in Belgium when other German residents got the benefits. By contrast in Weigel v Finanzlandesdirektion f\u00fcr Vorarlberg the Court of Justice rejected Mr Weigel's claim that a re-registration charge upon bringing his car to Austria violated his right to free movement. Although the tax was \"likely to have a negative bearing on the decision of migrant workers to exercise their right to freedom of movement\", because the charge applied equally to Austrians, in absence of EU legislation on the matter it had to be regarded as justified. Third, people must receive equal treatment regarding \"social advantages\", although the Court has approved residential qualifying periods. In Hendrix v Employee Insurance Institute the Court of Justice held that a Dutch national was not entitled to continue receiving incapacity benefits when he moved to Belgium, because the benefit was \"closely linked to the socio-economic situation\" of the Netherlands. Conversely, in Geven v Land Nordrhein-Westfalen the Court of Justice held that a Dutch woman living in the Netherlands, but working between 3 and 14 hours a week in Germany, did not have a right to receive German child benefits, even though the wife of a man who worked full-time in Germany but was resident in Austria could. The general justifications for limiting free movement in TFEU article 45(3) are \"public policy, public security or public health\", and there is also a general exception in article 45(4) for \"employment in the public service\".", "qas": [{"id": "775d0e339044a107f663bb1e073836ebd297a1fb", "question": "Who was NOT the defendant in the case with the Belgian footballer?", "answers": []}, {"id": "f4ad2be5b02cdde34eb15f741227aeb46649a148", "question": "What was the court's verdict on Mr. Weigel's case?", "answers": []}, {"id": "cda2973d5b995437cc9592a33e068b6a90c82f81", "question": "Where did Geven work?", "answers": []}, {"id": "0c9ff5b18dedda59acbd267f9e37f20658baa941", "question": "Which people speak Gaelic?", "answers": []}, {"id": "15d17b546f36c5c64bf1bf0c82965c53f0ec6d21", "question": "Who was the defendant in the case with the Belgian footballer?", "answers": []}, {"id": "fd0765821e52cc2c0baeb7517fb28cbd92ba7ef9", "question": "Which of the following cases didn't involve the Netherlands: Geven v Land Nordrhein-Westfalen or Groener v Minister for Education?", "answers": []}, {"id": "142063cc74c4a72109043b258d52319db7638bfc", "question": "Who was Mr. Schumacker arguing his benefits rights with?", "answers": []}, {"id": "7cd36c3301b4a270b7c6139323f43867a0a6be1b", "question": "What was the converse situation that made the German child benefits confusing?", "answers": []}, {"id": "8d114d7c406328b339e201762658e2cae32fb542", "question": "Who was the plaintiff in the case with a Dutch woman living in the Netherlands?", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "The concept of legal certainty is recognised one of the general principles of European Union law by the European Court of Justice since the 1960s.

In late 1958, Desilu Productions pitched its detective series The Untouchables to CBS; after that network rejected the show because of its use of violence, Desilu then presented it to ABC, which agreed to pick up the show, and debuted The Untouchables in April 1959. The series went on to quickly become \"immensely popular\".", "qas": [{"id": "e59d9c619d791bb0278af83de888159fa947a7ee", "question": "What was rejected by CBS?", "answers": []}, {"id": "af2e57f85e8c6549fda5614620c8e49dbb792104", "question": "The prime spots on tv before1958 mainly consisted of what type of shows", "answers": []}, {"id": "c2aba3af850dcd3eeb729ce7d4f7454bc5bc51d8", "question": "What did CBS do to The Untouchables?", "answers": []}, {"id": "042c9547d5b769e2386e5a394ec05f10dcf13189", "question": "What other TV station is mentioned besides ABC and Disney", "answers": []}, {"id": "06ba1cfbd83838b9b3083e8c49c60ebae99c48a6", "question": "Who was second to see The Untouchables?", "answers": []}, {"id": "6203070090736e76e1e8aca01ef91dcc8442186d", "question": "What year followed the renaming of the Disneyland anthology series?", "answers": []}, {"id": "3a9afc8955b50b49c3909b76ba60f4c408c5b88e", "question": "What did the name Disneyland represent after 1958.", "answers": []}, {"id": "d726b2aee431681687c1d325981bf2734fc75419", "question": "What happened after The Untouchables debuted?", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) (stylized in its logo as abc since 1957) is an American commercial broadcast television network that is owned by the Disney\u2013ABC Television Group, a subsidiary of Disney Media Networks division of The Walt Disney Company.

Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (Abulcasis) (936\u20131013) pioneered the preparation of medicines by sublimation and distillation. His Liber servitoris is of particular interest, as it provides the reader with recipes and explains how to prepare the `simples\u2019 from which were compounded the complex drugs then generally used. Sabur Ibn Sahl (d 869), was, however, the first physician to initiate pharmacopoedia, describing a large variety of drugs and remedies for ailments. Al-Biruni (973\u20131050) wrote one of the most valuable Islamic works on pharmacology, entitled Kitab al-Saydalah (The Book of Drugs), in which he detailed the properties of drugs and outlined the role of pharmacy and the functions and duties of the pharmacist. Avicenna, too, described no less than 700 preparations, their properties, modes of action, and their indications. He devoted in fact a whole volume to simple drugs in The Canon of Medicine. Of great impact were also the works by al-Maridini of Baghdad and Cairo, and Ibn al-Wafid (1008\u20131074), both of which were printed in Latin more than fifty times, appearing as De Medicinis universalibus et particularibus by 'Mesue' the younger, and the Medicamentis simplicibus by 'Abenguefit'.

Living in the 10th century, he wrote The foundations of the true properties of Remedies, amongst others describing arsenious oxide, and being acquainted with silicic acid. He made clear distinction between sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate, and drew attention to the poisonous nature of copper compounds, especially copper vitriol, and also lead compounds.

These insects spend most of their lives as grubs underground. They only pupate and then emerge from their burrows after 7, 13 or 17 years, at which point they fly about, breed, and then die after a few weeks at most. The logic for this is believed to be that the prime number intervals between emergences make it very difficult for predators to evolve that could specialize as predators on Magicicadas. If Magicicadas appeared at a non-prime number intervals, say every 12 years, then predators appearing every 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12 years would be sure to meet them. Over a 200-year period, average predator populations during hypothetical outbreaks of 14- and 15-year cicadas would be up to 2% higher than during outbreaks of 13- and 17-year cicadas.

But X.25 does it at the network layer of the OSI Model. Frame Relay does it at level two, the data link layer. Another major difference between X.25 and Frame Relay is that X.25 requires a handshake between the communicating parties before any user packets are transmitted. Frame Relay does not define any such handshakes. X.25 does not define any operations inside the packet network. It only operates at the user-network-interface (UNI). Thus, the network provider is free to use any procedure it wishes inside the network. X.25 does specify some limited re-transmission procedures at the UNI, and its link layer protocol (LAPB) provides conventional HDLC-type link management procedures. Frame Relay is a modified version of ISDN's layer two protocol, LAPD and LAPB. As such, its integrity operations pertain only between nodes on a link, not end-to-end. Any retransmissions must be carried out by higher layer protocols. The X.25 UNI protocol is part of the X.25 protocol suite, which consists of the lower three layers of the OSI Model. It was widely used at the UNI for packet switching networks during the 1980s and early 1990s, to provide a standardized interface into and out of packet networks. Some implementations used X.25 within the network as well, but its connection-oriented features made this setup cumbersome and inefficient. Frame relay operates principally at layer two of the OSI Model. However, its address field (the Data Link Connection ID, or DLCI) can be used at the OSI network layer, with a minimum set of procedures. Thus, it rids itself of many X.25 layer 3 encumbrances, but still has the DLCI as an ID beyond a node-to-node layer two link protocol. The simplicity of Frame Relay makes it faster and more efficient than X.25. Because Frame relay is a data link layer protocol, like X.25 it does not define internal network routing operations. For X.25 its packet IDs---the virtual circuit and virtual channel numbers have to be correlated to network addresses. The same is true for Frame Relays DLCI. How this is done is up to the network provider. Frame Relay, by virtue of having no network layer procedures is connection-oriented at layer two, by using the HDLC/LAPD/LAPB Set Asynchronous Balanced Mode (SABM). X.25 connections are typically established for each communication session, but it does have a feature allowing a limited amount of traffic to be passed across the UNI without the connection-oriented handshake. For a while, Frame Relay was used to interconnect LANs across wide area networks. However, X.25 and well as Frame Relay have been supplanted by the Internet Protocol (IP) at the network layer, and the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and or versions of Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) at layer two. A typical configuration is to run IP over ATM or a version of MPLS. <Uyless Black, X.25 and Related Protocols, IEEE Computer Society, 1991> <Uyless Black, Frame Relay Networks, McGraw-Hill, 1998> <Uyless Black, MPLS and Label Switching Networks, Prentice Hall, 2001> < Uyless Black, ATM, Volume I, Prentice Hall, 1995>", "qas": [{"id": "56f787359b34bf7d6f7903d2c2c138313ca219a0", "question": "What does X.25 do to start a connection?", "answers": []}, {"id": "bf7ac9c3624f84d848f279f3c9ac310cfd3fb676", "question": "Which of the following does not have to correlate to network addresses: virtual circuit numbers, packet networks or virtual channel numbers?", "answers": []}, {"id": "2a2014c9fdfe54de7cc7b219927645622506b9b2", "question": "Frame relay is similar to X.25 in what?", "answers": []}, {"id": "4c5bb2e44b07e36fda36c578824a7f902f7e8fb4", "question": "What was popular at the UNI during the last two decades of the 20th century?", "answers": []}, {"id": "ed54c9fdddfdf0fe207922aa2119f02321893394", "question": "What no longer operates at the network layer?", "answers": []}, {"id": "a2a3d19faac0e43379806c01427eb205a7fe92b6", "question": "Which of the following does not provide connection-oriented operations: X.25, Frame Relay, or the OSI Model?", "answers": []}, {"id": "c5ad0bcf861eb17f8f8f3b8ecf003791463d19c5", "question": "Which of the following is not an acronym: X.25, HDLC, or ISDN?", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "Tymnet was an international data communications network headquartered in San Jose, CA that utilized virtual call packet switched technology and used X.25, SNA/SDLC, BSC and ASCII interfaces to connect host computers (servers)at thousands of large companies, educational institutions, and government agencies.

In 1903, Harvard Stadium introduced a new era into football with the first-ever permanent reinforced concrete stadium of its kind in the country. The stadium's structure actually played a role in the evolution of the college game. Seeking to reduce the alarming number of deaths and serious injuries in the sport, Walter Camp (former captain of the Yale football team), suggested widening the field to open up the game. But the stadium was too narrow to accommodate a wider playing surface. So, other steps had to be taken. Camp would instead support revolutionary new rules for the 1906 season.

Through the treatment of its indigenous peoples during westward expansion, the United States took on the form of an imperial power prior to any attempts at external imperialism. This internal form of empire has been referred to as \"internal colonialism\". Participation in the African slave trade and the subsequent treatment of its 12 to 15 million Africans is viewed by some to be a more modern extension of America's \"internal colonialism\".
